 * 
 * Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly
 * the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a
 * tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s
 * could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Given tree s:
 * 
 * ⁠    3
 * ⁠   / \
 * ⁠  4   5
 * ⁠ / \
 * ⁠1   2
 * 
 * Given tree t:
 * 
 * ⁠  4 
 * ⁠ / \
 * ⁠1   2
 * 
 * Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree
 * of s.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Given tree s:
 * 
 * ⁠    3
 * ⁠   / \
 * ⁠  4   5
 * ⁠ / \
 * ⁠1   2
 * ⁠   /
 * ⁠  0
 * 
 * Given tree t:
 * 
 * ⁠  4
 * ⁠ / \
 * ⁠1   2
 * 
 * Return false.
