 *
 * Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some
 * elements appear twice and others appear once.
 * 
 * Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
 * 
 * Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the
 * returned list does not count as extra space.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input:
 * [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
 * 
 * Output:
 * [5,6]
